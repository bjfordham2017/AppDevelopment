//: ## Exercise: Putting on a Show
//: Your friend is done with the pet show. With your help, it was a big success. Now your friend is putting on a concert. Tickets are for sale at $10 per ticket. The room rental is $50. Making posters for the show costs $40. Help your friend figure out if the show is going to make money or lose money.
let numberOfTickets = 150

let ticketPrice = 10

let roomRentalFee = 1000

let posterCost = 40

let totalTicketValue = numberOfTickets * ticketPrice

let totalExpenses = roomRentalFee + posterCost

let totalIncomeOfShow = totalTicketValue - totalExpenses

//: - callout(Exercise): Using the code above as a reference, use let statements to define constants to better solve your friendâ€™s problem.\
